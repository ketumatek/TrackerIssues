hi i know that in your last update 1.22 we can rename each of the 8 tracks.(vertical)
it is possible to rename all the track line in song mode (horizontal) to be more clear. example 1 can be intro, 5  can be break, 10 end....
if not yet could you make this in a future upgrade. hope you understand my request.
thanks
